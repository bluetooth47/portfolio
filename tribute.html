                <h2>Nikola Tesla: A Visionary Genius Who Electrified the World</h2>
                <p id="tribute-info">Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, engineer, and physicist
                    whose pioneering contributions to science and technology forever transformed modern civilization.
                    Known for his unyielding passion for innovation, Tesla’s groundbreaking work laid the foundation for
                    alternating current (AC) electricity, wireless communication, and numerous other advancements that
                    continue to shape our world.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="section_2">
                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>Born in Smiljan, Croatia (then part of the Austrian Empire), Tesla showed an early fascination with
                    engineering and the natural world. He studied at the Polytechnic School in Graz and later at the
                    University of Prague, where he became captivated by the mysteries of electricity.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="section_3">
                <h2>Contributions to Electricity</h2>
                <p>Tesla’s most famous achievement is his development of alternating current (AC) systems, which became
                    the standard for electricity distribution worldwide due to its efficiency over long distances. He
                    demonstrated the superiority of AC during the "War of the Currents," a rivalry with Thomas Edison,
                    who promoted direct current (DC). Tesla’s collaboration with industrialist George Westinghouse
                    helped electrify cities and enabled the first large-scale AC power system at the 1893 World's
                    Columbian Exposition in Chicago.</p>

                <h2>Inventions and Innovations</h2>
                <p>Tesla held over 300 patents and envisioned technologies that were far ahead of his time, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Tesla Coil: A high-voltage transformer still used in radio technology and scientific
                        demonstrations.</li>
                    <li>Wireless Power Transmission: Tesla dreamed of transmitting electricity wirelessly and built the
                        Wardenclyffe Tower as a prototype for a global wireless energy system.</li>
                    <li>Radio and Wireless Communication: Though Guglielmo Marconi is often credited with inventing the
                        radio, Tesla’s patents and experiments laid the groundwork for modern wireless communication.
                    </li>
                    <li>Electric Motors: His innovations in induction motors revolutionized the field of
                        electromagnetism.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="section_5">
                <h2>The Visionary Ahead of His Time</h2>
                <p>Tesla's ideas often seemed like science fiction to his contemporaries. He theorized about
                    technologies like radar, robotics, artificial intelligence, and even harnessing renewable energy
                    sources. While not all of his projects came to fruition, his vision continues to inspire engineers
                    and scientists.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="section_6">
                <h2>Challenges and Legacy</h2>
                <p>Despite his brilliance, Tesla struggled financially throughout his life, as many of his ideas were
                    too ambitious or poorly funded. He passed away in relative obscurity in 1943, yet his legacy has
                    grown immensely since then. Today, Tesla is celebrated as a symbol of creativity, innovation, and
                    the power of imagination.

                    The world Tesla dreamed of—one powered by renewable energy, global communication networks, and
                    limitless potential—is one we continue to strive toward, guided by the spirit of his genius.</p>
